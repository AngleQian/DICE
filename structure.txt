- central part methodology is valid

Creep test

MTS machine - relationship from strain to force
X strain = 7000 N
So in later experiments, we focus on reaching on X strain

Physical experiment

Control variables: strain (based on the above force), leaf spring (except liners)
Independent variable: Linear (liner 1, 2) x (80%, 100%, 120% length)
Dependent variable: graph with x axis as time, y axis as vertical displacement
